 * btif_rf_request_port_settings()
 *
 *     Requests a change to the current port settings. The caller may set

 *     "parmMask" field of the structure identifies which fields are
 *     important.
 *
 *     After a successful call to this function, RFCOMM exchanges
 *     the parameters with the remote device on the channel. After the
 *     remote device responds, RFCOMM generates an RFEVENT_PORT_NEG_CNF event
 *     to indicate which settings were accepted or rejected. Bits in
 *     the "parmMask" field indicate whether the parameter was accepted
 *     (bit set) or rejected (bit clear).
 *
 *     If the remote device rejects some of the parameters, subsequent
 *     requests can be sent with modified parameters until a final
 *     agreement is reached.
 *
 * Requires:

 *         is received.
 *
 * Returns:
 *     BT_STS_PENDING - The port negotiation will be sent to the
 *         remote device.  If the remote device responds to the request,
 *         RFCOMM sends an RFEVENT_PORT_NEG_CNF event. If the operation times

 * RF_OpenClientChannel()

 *
 * Parameters:
 *     remDev - Identifies the remote device.
 *
 *     serviceId - Identifies the RFCOMM server ID on the remote device.
 *         The server ID can be determined by querying the remote device's
 *         SDP server.
 *
 *     channel - Provides information about the client channel. The
 *         "callback", "maxFrameSize", and "priority" fields must
 *         be initialized prior to the call. This structure is owned by
 *         RFCOMM until the channel is closed.
 *
 *     credit - This parameter is used to specify an initial amount of credit
 *         that will be granted to a client upon connection.  The amount of
 *         credit that is advanced tells the client how many RFCOMM packets it
 *         can send before flow control is shut off from client to server.
 *         In order to allow the client to send more data, RF_AdvanceCredit must
 *         be called.  If the remote device does not support credit-based flow
 *         control, then the flow control is controlled automatically by the FC
 *         bit in the modem status command.
 *
 *         See RF_AdvanceCredit for a discussion of flow control.
 *
 * Returns:
 *     BT_STS_PENDING - The request to open the channel was sent.
 *         If the remote device accepts the request, RFCOMM will
 *         generate an RFEVENT_OPEN event. If the channel is rejected, RFCOMM
 *         will generate an RFEVENT_CLOSED event.
 *
 *     BT_STS_FAILED - The L2CAP connection is not ready for RFCOMM

 *
 *     BT_STS_NO_RESOURCES - The system has run out of resources
